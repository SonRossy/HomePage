        <intro>
          My name is Son-Rossy Dorvil. my major is computer sience at BridgeWater state University.
          Computer is my passion, I have always wondered how a computer works, how all those magics inside of a computer happen; this is one of the reasons now I am a computer science student.
          I am currently living in Boston Ma, I spend most of time studying and coding; when I feel too exhausted from learning, I usually take a break and play video game for a while.
          playing game is not just one of my hubbies, i actually make them as well. in addition, i have an arduino board which is a controller device that you can use to code robot;
          so i know a thing or two about robotics as well. if you want to know more my skills, you can either dowload my resume below or scroll down to my <a href="#pro">professional </a> section.
